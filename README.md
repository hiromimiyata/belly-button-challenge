Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals interesting insights about the microbial species present in different individuals' navels.

# Background
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset is based on a study conducted to understand the microbial diversity in human navels. The dataset contains information about the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), which represent different microbial species found in the navels of individuals. The dataset also includes demographic information about the individuals.

# Features
The dashboard provides the following features:

Top 10 OTUs Bar Chart: Displays a horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 OTUs found in an individual's navel. The chart uses sample values as the bar heights, OTU IDs as the labels, and OTU labels as the hover text.

Bubble Chart: Shows a bubble chart representing each sample in the dataset. The chart uses OTU IDs for the x-axis, sample values for the y-axis, and sample values for the marker size. The color of the markers represents the OTU IDs, and the text values show the corresponding OTU labels.

Demographic Information: Displays the demographic information of the selected individual. The information includes the individual's ID, ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and weekly belly button washing frequency.

Interactive Dropdown: Allows you to select a specific individual from the dropdown menu to update the charts and demographic information based on the selected individual.
